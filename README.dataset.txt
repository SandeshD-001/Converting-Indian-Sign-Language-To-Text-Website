# **Introduction to the Indian Sign Language (ISL) Model**

This project focuses on creating a precise and real-time detection model for Indian Sign Language (ISL) gestures. We utilize the YOLO-NAS Object Detection model with the coco/14 checkpoint and leverage Roboflow for data preprocessing, which includes annotating various images and balancing classes. The training, validation, and testing phases are executed using a Google Colab notebook, followed by live detection implementation in PyCharm. This model aims to facilitate seamless communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community by translating ISL gestures into text and speech.
